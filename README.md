Problem Definition:  
The challenge we face today revolves around the effective handling and utilization of vast datasets, spanning fields like climate patterns and social trends. This challenge encompasses several key aspects: accessing the data itself, discovering valuable insights hidden within it, presenting complex data in a clear manner, extracting meaningful business insights, and fostering a structured approach for data exploration. In essence, the problem lies in the complexity of managing, analyzing, and deriving practical benefits from extensive and diverse datasets, which hinders our ability to tap into the vast potential of big data for informed decision-making and innovation.  
Objective:  
The objective for the problem statement is to leverage IBM Cloud Databases to perform comprehensive big data analysis, enabling the discovery of concealed insights within extensive datasets, such as climate trends and social patterns. This analysis should culminate in the visualization of these findings and the extraction of valuable business intelligence. The ultimate goal is to promote data-driven decision-making and exploration of the limitless potential of big data in various domains.  
Design Thinking:
Abstract:  
Big data analysis is the process of examining and analyzing large and complex datasets to uncover hidden patterns and insights. This can be a challenging task, as big data sets are often unstructured, semi-structured, and distributed across multiple sources.  
IBM Cloud Databases offers a wide range of services that can be used for big data analysis. These services include:  
IBM Cloud Data Engine: A fully managed data lake service that provides a scalable and secure platform for storing, processing, and analyzing big data.  
IBM Cloud Object Storage: A highly scalable and durable object storage service that can be used to store any type of data, including big data.  
IBM Cloudant: A fully managed NoSQL database that is optimized for high performance and scalability.  
IBM Watson Studio: A cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) for data scientists and machine learning engineers.  
These services can be used together to build and deploy big data analytics solutions. For example, you could use IBM Cloud Data Engine to store and process your big data, IBM Cloud Object Storage to store your raw data, IBM Cloudant to store your processed data, and IBM Watson Studio to develop and deploy your analytics models.
